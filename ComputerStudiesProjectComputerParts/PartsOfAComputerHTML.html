<h3>Input Device</h3>
<p>
Input devices are devices that translate a phisical event into zero's and one's. Some examples are a keyboard, which takes button presses to convert to electronic signals, and a microphone, which takes vibrations in the air to convert.

<h3>Output Device</h3>
<p>
Output devices are devices that take electronic signals and convert them into phisical events. Some examples are a speaker, which takes electronic signals to convert to sound vibrations, and a monitor, which converts electronic signals into light.

<h3>Central Processing Unit (CPU)</h3>
<p>
A Central Processing Unit, or CPU, is what does the main processing of the computer. It is divided into two parts, the ALU, and the Control Unit.

<a name="ALU"></a>
<h3>Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU)</h3>
<p>
An Arithmetic Logic Unit, or ALU, is what carries the bulk of the processing, made entirely for logic and arithmetic. It takes information from the Control Unit to calculate.
</p>

</div>

<div>
<a name="Control"></a>
<h3>Control Unit</h3>
<p>
The Control Unit is the "leader" of the computer. It takes the imformation from the unput devices and gives the information to the ALU and sends those calculations to the output devices.

<a name="RAM"></a>
<h3>Random Access Memory</h3>
<p>
A Random Access Memory, or RAM, is the short-term memory a computer uses when processing. It requires energy to store information, but in return it is much faster than the long-term memory.

<a name="Optical"></a>
<h3>Optical Memory</h3>
<p>
Optical Memory is a kind of long-term memory used by reflecting light one direction or another, to represent zero's and ones. Some examples of such are CD's and DVD's.

<a name="Magnetic"></a>
<h3>Magnetic Memory</h3>
<p>
Magnetic Memory is a type of long term memory that stores information by magnets facing one direction or another, to represent zero's and one's. An example of such is a Floppy Disc.

<div>
<a name="Flash"></a>
<h3>Flash Memory</h3>
<p>
Flash Memory is a type of long-term storage that has a finite amound of uses, unlike the other types of memory. Some examples are SSDs and SD cards.
</p>

<div>
<a name="Logic"></a>
<h3>Logic Gates</h3>
<p>
Logic Gates are electronic components that takes two electronic inputs and provides an output. Some examples of such are an AND gate and an OR gate.
